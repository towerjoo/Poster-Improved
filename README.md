Poster-Improved
===============

I am a Web Developer, and use firefox/chrome Poster a lot in daily life, but I don't
know why *Poster is so inconvenient to use*, e.g **lack of show result as rendered html** (it's hard
to read the source even for a programmer!), hard to add/change post parameters, not so smart 
to handle URL.

So it goes to me to make such a tool to ease my daily life, or it may apply to you too.

This will be an extension for chrome/firefox as a HTTP client to ease the debug.

See [Firefox Poster][firefox_poster] or [Chrome Poster][chrome_poster] as the example.

## Features

1. The original Poster's features
2. support to show the rendered html for response
3. a smart parameters add/change
4. smart url filling


## Roadmap

1. Chrome Extension will be finished At first
2. Firefix will be done after 1


## Thanks

Thanks for [Chrome Poster][chrome_poster] project, and PI is based on that.
